            <p>Source: Make a document that will be used as a source. Make use of a well-established procedure (In this case, the Java language)
                <br>
                <br>Compiler: Use a source code compiler to compile your document. The compiler checks for errors and won’t let you compile until It’s satisfied that everything will run correctly.
                <br>
                <br>Output/Byte code: The compiler creates a new document, coded into Java bytecode. Any device that can run Java will be able to interpret and translate this file into something that it can use. The compiled bytecode is platform Independent.
                <br>
                <br>JVM: Your friends don’t have a physical Java Machine, but they all have a virtual Java machine (implemented In software) running inside their electronic gadgets. The bytecode is read and executed by the virtual machine.</p>
